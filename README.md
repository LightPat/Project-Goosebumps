## Classes (abilities basically)
### Electromaster/Railgun
* Based off Mikoto Misaka, controls and sees EM waves
* Can shoot arcs of electricity to a target, as long as that target is conductive. This should be assigned in the stats script
### Teleporter
* Based off Koroko Shirai, can teleport self and objects/players around it
* Assign if an object is teleportable in the stats script
### Lord of Time
* Can slow down or speed up time for a short period
* Useful for melee weapons that can parry bullets
### Psychic
* Can take over and control other player’s or enemy’s minds and control them for a duration.
* Also is able to throw objects using telekinesis
* Able to communicate via telepathy

## Weapon Ideas
### Scar Rifle
* Not actually a scar L, just the main rifle model for the game since the scar looks sick
### Shifting Umbrella
* The umbrella shifts between a steel canopy that can block bullets and magic, and a typical umbrella canopy that can slow the user’s descent in the air.
* The umbrella operates using magic, so it is not a melee weapon, but it is a wand
### Railgun
* Shoots a steel projectile at ridiculously high speeds. Everything it runs into leaves a huge particle effect in its wake.
### Shadow Knives (pair, for parrying like in ranger’s apprentice)
* Based on King Arthur’s knife carnwennan.
* Gives the user the ability to go invisible and not make noise for a period of time
* Hitting an opponent in the back triggers an execution animation and deals critical damage
### Excalibur
* Based off Saber’s excalibur in Fate UBW
* After chaining lots of hits together, it gives its user the ability to unleash a devastating blast of holy light. This light blinds all players in the same room as it, like a really powerful flashbang. And deals huge damage to the target.
